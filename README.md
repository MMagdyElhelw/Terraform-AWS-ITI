# Terraform-AWS-ITI Project

## Overview

This project sets up a secure and scalable cloud infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. The architecture includes:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** An isolated network environment for AWS resources.
- **Public and Private Subnets:** Segregation of resources based on accessibility requirements.
- **EC2 Instances:** Virtual servers for running applications.
- **NAT Gateway:** Enables instances in private subnets to access the internet securely.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Route traffic to backend servers
- **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic across instances to ensure high availability.
- **S3 and DynamoDB:** Used for remote state management

The diagram represents a VPC and two LoadBalancers designed to handle internet traffic efficiently using Nginx as reverse proxy and backend web servers across multiple availability zones (AZs).
## Architecture Components

1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**
- Provides an isolated network environment for AWS resources.

2. **Internet Gateway (IGW):**
- Connects the VPC to the internet, enabling resources in public subnets to access the internet.

3. **Public Subnets:**
- Two public subnets are created with a public route table.
- These subnets contain internet-facing resources, like the Bastion Host.

4. **Private Subnets:**
 - Two private subnets are created with a private route table.
  - These subnets contain internal resources, such as application servers.

5. **Route Tables:**
  - *Public Route Table:* Routes traffic from public subnets to the Internet Gateway.
   - *Private Route Table:* Routes internal traffic and directs internet-bound traffic through the NAT Gateway.

6. **NAT Gateway:**
  - Allows instances in private subnets to initiate outbound internet connections while preventing unsolicited inbound traffic.

7. **Elastic IP:**
  - Provides a static public IP address for the NAT Gateway.

8. **Security Groups:**
  - Act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic for instances.

9. **Nginx Instances:**
  - EC2 instances running Nginx, located in public subnets,used as a reverse proxy.â€‹
10. **Apache Backend Instances:**
   - located in private subnets, handling web traffic.

11. **Load Balancer:**
   - Distributes incoming traffic across EC2 instances to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.





## Getting Started

1. **Install Terraform:**
   - Download and install Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   - Ensure your AWS credentials are set up on your machine, typically using the AWS CLI.

3. **Initialize Terraform:**
   - Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.

4. **Plan the Deployment:**
   - Execute `terraform plan` to preview the infrastructure changes.

5. **Apply the Deployment:**
   - Run `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure on AWS.
